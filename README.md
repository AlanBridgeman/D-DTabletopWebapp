# D-DTabletopWebapp
The idea of this project is to create a web based D&amp;D system that augments the reality of D&amp;D Tabletop games tangents and all. Simply put having tried several tools on the market for this I found none of them feel like the "real" experience and give you the freedom to get a whole 1 round done in six hours of sitting around the table. Pace as fast or as slow as your want is I guess the essential idea
